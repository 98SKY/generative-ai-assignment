# Assignment 6 – Exception Handling

## 📌 Overview
This assignment focuses on handling runtime errors and unexpected user inputs using Python’s built-in exception handling system.

The goal is to write simple, safe, and robust programs using:
- try
- except
- else
- finally
- raise (custom exceptions)
- Handling common built-in exceptions

No OOP or advanced concepts are used. The focus is purely on exception handling.
